# ESPHome sonoff setup files

These are my esphome setup files for the different sonoff devices i have.

* Sonoff S20 - a wallplug switch
* Sonoff TH16 - single relay and extra input for additional sensors.
* Sonoff dual - Mine is labeled R2, but since it does not have the relays directly connected, it must be a R1. Controlling the relays over the  serial cnnection, this device is a bit trouble to get working. Newer version (Propper R2) should have the GPIO directly connected.
